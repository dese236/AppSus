          World Of Books Group is a circular economy, for-profit business that
          supports charities and protects the planet by enabling more goods to
          be reused. From a single bag of books we now re-home and recycle over
          75 million used books a year. We buy books from charity shops and
          other sources, or through Ziffit – our App and website. We sell them
          on our own website and on other platforms – we are the largest volume
          seller on eBay globally. Our recycling partners turn unwanted books
          into other useful products – nothing goes to waste. This is supported
          by our own proprietary software platform which streamlines our
          processes. We also provide software services to charities and other
          re-sellers to help them maximise their e-commerce sales. As a recently
          accredited B Corp (Business For Good), we are growing quickly in the
          UK and internationally. With nearly 300,000 sq ft of warehouses in
          Cincinnati (US), West Sussex (UK) and a new state-of-the-art warehouse
          in Coventry (UK), sales in 2020 will be nearly £80 million. Our
          company was founded on an ethos to do good, to help charities and to
          make a positive impact. We don’t believe that books should only be
          read once, or have a single owner. We want to share the love of
          literature by rereading and reusing books. This is why our prices are
          low and delivery is free - to help millions of used books find new
          homes in over 190 countries every year.
